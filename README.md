# Instagram Bot
This is an Instagram bot that scrapes followers from a selected user, cleans the list for duplicates and potential fake accounts, then "likes" the first 3 posts from each account in the cleaned list.

# Step 1:
You must download the latest <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home">chromedriver</a> and compatible version of google chrome. Follow the instructions on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrkj4tdXngY">video</a>.

# Step 2: 
Once the browser has been opened via step 1, log into your account on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> or you can insert your login details within the function `enter_login_details`.

# Step 3: 
From here you can begin using any of the functions available, which are listed below the notes section.

# Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Remember that whenever you want a function to be used, you must call the function within the code. The reason I set it up this way is so that you can edit the flow of what specific actions you'd like to take.</li>
  <li>You can call multiple functions at a time.</li>
  <li>There are certain functions that I used for my own business which required disqualifying users with specific words that might be found in their usernames. These functions can be disregarded unless you'd like to alter them to fit your own criteria.</li>
  <li>Reminder that Instagram has limits on the number of actions you can take within a duration of time. Exceeding these limits can lead to Instagram blocking your account temporarily or indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
